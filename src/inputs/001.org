* Q1
Please design an emacs startup framework along the lines of doom
emacs, but simpler.  One that allows the user to edit ini-style
variables, and not elisp.  This framework needs to be able to
withstand mistakes in the config file, and not crash.
* A1
Here is a basic outline of a simple emacs startup framework, along the
lines you described:

Start with a minimal init.el file that sets up basic environment
variables, such as the load-path and the default package archives.

Create an config.ini file to store all configuration variables, with a
simple key-value format. You can use a library like python-iniparse or
configparser to parse the file in elisp.

Use conditionals to handle errors and mistakes in the config.ini
file. For example, you can wrap all configuration variables in
condition-case forms to catch errors and prevent the entire framework
from crashing.

Implement functions to load different parts of the configuration, such
as keybindings, theme, and packages. These functions should use the
variables from the config.ini file to customize emacs accordingly.

Finally, in the init.el file, call the functions that load the
configuration to complete the startup process.

This framework provides a simple, ini-style configuration while still
allowing the user to customize emacs to their liking. The use of
conditionals to handle errors makes it more resilient and less prone
to crashing.
* Q2
Thank you.  Please write the init.el file which uses configparser to
read the config.ini file.  Also, please write the error handling and
the configuration loading to load up packages using use-package, helm,
doom-themes, and using the doom-one theme.
* A2
Here's the init.el file that implements the framework as described:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Require configparser library
(require 'configparser)

;; Load the config file
(defun load-config-file ()
  (let ((config-file "~/.emacs.d/config.ini"))
    (if (file-exists-p config-file)
        (progn
          (setq config (configparser-parse-ini-file config-file))
          (message "Config file loaded successfully"))
      (message "Config file not found"))))

;; Error handling
(condition-case nil
    (load-config-file)
  (error
   (message "Error loading config file")))

;; Load packages using use-package
(use-package use-package
  :ensure t)

;; Load Helm
(use-package helm
  :ensure t
  :init
  (helm-mode 1)
  (setq helm-autoresize-mode t)
  (setq helm-buffer-max-length nil))

;; Load doom-themes
(use-package doom-themes
  :ensure t
  :config
  (load-theme 'doom-one t))

;; Load packages from the config file
(defun load-packages ()
  (let ((packages (configparser-get config "packages" "enabled-packages")))
    (mapc (lambda (pkg)
            (use-package (intern pkg)
              :ensure t))
          (split-string packages ","))))

;; Load configuration
(condition-case nil
    (load-packages)
  (error
   (message "Error loading packages")))
#+end_src
Note that this code assumes that the config.ini file has a section
named packages with a key named enabled-packages containing a
comma-separated list of package names. This code also assumes that the
packages specified in the config.ini file are available in the default
package archives.
* Q3
Please create the example config.ini file
* A3
Here's an example config.ini file that uses the configuration outlined in the previous code:
#+begin_src ini
[packages]
enabled-packages = helm, doom-themes, use-package
#+end_src
* Q4
Thank you, that is very helpful.  Could you please re-do it with each
'enabled-package' being on separate lines?  I am trying to eliminate
failures of the complete system if the user makes a mistake in the
config.ini file
* A4
Sure! Here's an updated config.ini file with each enabled-package on
separate lines, to make it more resilient to mistakes:
#+begin_src ini
[packages]
enabled-package = helm
enabled-package = doom-themes
enabled-package = use-package
#+end_src
With this format, even if a line is accidentally deleted or altered,
the rest of the configuration will still be processed correctly, and
only the affected package will not be loaded.
* Q5
Thank you.  Does the init.el file need to be changed?
* A5
Yes, the init.el file needs to be updated to handle the new format of
the config.ini file. Here's the updated code:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Require configparser library
(require 'configparser)

;; Load the config file
(defun load-config-file ()
  (let ((config-file "~/.emacs.d/config.ini"))
    (if (file-exists-p config-file)
        (progn
          (setq config (configparser-parse-ini-file config-file))
          (message "Config file loaded successfully"))
      (message "Config file not found"))))

;; Error handling
(condition-case nil
    (load-config-file)
  (error
   (message "Error loading config file")))

;; Load packages using use-package
(use-package use-package
  :ensure t)

;; Load packages from the config file
(defun load-packages ()
  (let ((enabled-packages (configparser-get-all config "packages" "enabled-package")))
    (mapc (lambda (pkg)
            (use-package (intern pkg)
              :ensure t))
          enabled-packages)))

;; Load configuration
(condition-case nil
    (load-packages)
  (error
   (message "Error loading packages")))
#+end_src
This code uses configparser-get-all to get all values for the key
enabled-package in the section packages. The resulting list is then
passed to the mapc function, which loads each package using
use-package.
* Q6
Thank you, that is much closer to what I want.  What happens if
someone mis-spells "enabled-package" in the config.ini file?  Will the
'configparser-parse-ini-file' function work properly?
* A6
If the key enabled-package is misspelled in the config.ini file, the
configparser-parse-ini-file function will still work, but the values
for the misspelled key will not be returned by configparser-get-all.

To handle this scenario, you can add error handling code to the
load-packages function to catch any errors and print a message
indicating that the key was not found. Here's an updated version of
the load-packages function that includes this error handling:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun load-packages ()
  (let ((enabled-packages (configparser-get-all config "packages" "enabled-package")))
    (if enabled-packages
        (mapc (lambda (pkg)
                (use-package (intern pkg)
                  :ensure t))
              enabled-packages)
      (message "Key 'enabled-package' not found in config file"))))
#+end_src
This function uses an if statement to check if enabled-packages is
non-nil, and if it is, it loads the packages using mapc as before. If
enabled-packages is nil, a message is displayed indicating that the
key was not found in the config file.
* Q7
OK, so to make sure I understand this, any mistake in typing
'enabled-packages' will only mess up that one line from the config.ini
file, but all of the other ones will work properly.  Is that correct?
* A7
Yes, that is correct. If the key enabled-package is misspelled in the
config.ini file, the configparser-parse-ini-file function will still
work and parse the rest of the file, but the values for the misspelled
key will not be returned by configparser-get-all. In this case, the
error handling code in the load-packages function will catch the error
and display a message indicating that the key was not found. The rest
of the configuration will still be processed correctly.
* Q8
Thank you.  Will this be a silent error, or will we be able to show
the user an error buffer showing them which part we think they got
wrong?
* A8
The error handling code in the load-packages function will display a
message in the echo area (also known as the "minibuffer") indicating
that the key was not found, but it will not create an error buffer
showing the problem.

If you would like to display the error buffer, you can modify the
error handling code to use the display-error function. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun load-packages ()
  (let ((enabled-packages (configparser-get-all config "packages" "enabled-package")))
    (if enabled-packages
        (mapc (lambda (pkg)
                (use-package (intern pkg)
                  :ensure t))
              enabled-packages)
      (display-error
       (error "Key 'enabled-package' not found in config file") nil))))
#+end_src
This code uses the display-error function to display the error message
in an error buffer. The error message will be displayed in a buffer
named *ERROR*, which can be viewed by the user to see what went wrong.
* Q9
Yes, thank you.  We definitely need an "error buffer".  However, I
don't like that it is a transient buffer.  Could you please put it in
a file called 'config.ini-errors', in the same directory as the
config.ini file, and open that buffer to the line with the error?  I
am trying help emacs new users to have an experience as hard to break
as vscode.
* A9
To write the error message to a file instead of displaying it in a
transient buffer, you can modify the error handling code in the
load-packages function to use the with-temp-file function to write the
error message to a file. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun load-packages ()
  (let ((enabled-packages (configparser-get-all config "packages" "enabled-package")))
    (if enabled-packages
        (mapc (lambda (pkg)
                (use-package (intern pkg)
                  :ensure t))
              enabled-packages)
      (with-temp-file (expand-file-name "config.ini-errors"
                                        (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name)))
        (insert (format "Error: Key 'enabled-package' not found in config file"))))))
#+end_src
This code uses the with-temp-file function to write the error message
to a file named config.ini-errors in the same directory as the
config.ini file. The error message will be written to the file each
time the function is called, so it is important to make sure the file
is cleared or deleted before running the function again.

Additionally, if you would like to open the file at the line with the
error, you can modify the error handling code to use the
find-file-other-window function to open the file and the goto-char
function to move to the end of the file where the error message was
written. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun load-packages ()
  (let ((enabled-packages (configparser-get-all config "packages" "enabled-package")))
    (if enabled-packages
        (mapc (lambda (pkg)
                (use-package (intern pkg)
                  :ensure t))
              enabled-packages)
      (with-temp-file (expand-file-name "config.ini-errors"
                                        (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name)))
        (insert (format "Error: Key 'enabled-package' not found in config file"))
        (let ((error-file (buffer-file-name)))
          (kill-buffer (current-buffer))
          (find-file-other-window error-file)
          (goto-char (point-max)))))))
#+end_src
This code uses the find-file-other-window function to open the file in
another window, and the goto-char function to move to the end of the
file where the error message was written. The user will then be able
to see the error message and correct any issues in the config.ini
file.
* Q10
Thank you for helping me with that gotcha.  Will that file only be
overwritten if emacs is restarted, or on every time there is an error
in the config.ini file?
* A10
The file config.ini-errors will be overwritten every time the
load-packages function is called and an error is encountered in the
config.ini file. The with-temp-file function creates a new buffer,
writes the contents to the buffer, and then closes the buffer,
effectively overwriting any previous contents of the file.

So, each time the function is run and an error is encountered, the
error message will be written to a new file with the same name,
overwriting any previous contents. This means that if you run the
function multiple times and encounter multiple errors, only the last
error message will be present in the config.ini-errors file.

If you would like to keep a record of all error messages, you could
modify the code to append the error message to the file instead of
overwriting it. You can do this by using the append-to-file function
instead of with-temp-file. For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun load-packages ()
  (let ((enabled-packages (configparser-get-all config "packages" "enabled-package")))
    (if enabled-packages
        (mapc (lambda (pkg)
                (use-package (intern pkg)
                  :ensure t))
              enabled-packages)
      (append-to-file (format "Error: Key 'enabled-package' not found in config file\n")
                      nil
                      (expand-file-name "config.ini-errors"
                                        (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))))
      (find-file-other-window (expand-file-name "config.ini-errors"
                                                 (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))))
      (goto-char (point-max)))))
#+end_src
This code uses the append-to-file function to append the error message
to the end of the config.ini-errors file, instead of overwriting the
entire file. Each time the function is run and an error is
encountered, the error message will be appended to the file, so all
error messages will be preserved.
* Q11
That's a great idea.  Can we put timestamps between each set of
errors, so my users will know which errors they are looking at?
* A11
Yes, you can add timestamps to the config.ini-errors file to indicate
when each error occurred. To do this, you can modify the code as
follows:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun load-packages ()
  (let ((enabled-packages (configparser-get-all config "packages" "enabled-package")))
    (if enabled-packages
        (mapc (lambda (pkg)
                (use-package (intern pkg)
                  :ensure t))
              enabled-packages)
      (append-to-file (format "%s: Error: Key 'enabled-package' not found in config file\n"
                              (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %T"))
                      nil
                      (expand-file-name "config.ini-errors"
                                        (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))))
      (find-file-other-window (expand-file-name "config.ini-errors"
                                                 (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))))
      (goto-char (point-max)))))
#+end_src
This code uses the format-time-string function to generate a timestamp
for each error, in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". The timestamp is
then appended to the error message, and the entire message is appended
to the config.ini-errors file using the append-to-file function.

This way, each error message in the config.ini-errors file will be
accompanied by a timestamp, allowing you to easily determine when each
error occurred.
